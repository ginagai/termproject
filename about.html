            Hello! My name is Wenli Gai, and I am a second-year graduate student at Boston University, pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science. 
            With a strong passion for technology and problem-solving, I have spent the past two years deepening my understanding of software engineering, 
            machine learning, and data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects, including developing a full-stack web application or building a predictive 
            model using machine learning. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork 
            and effective communication in achieving project goals.
